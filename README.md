## Getting Started 🚀

### What is Tailwind CSS? 🌬️

Tailwind CSS is basically a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is a highly
customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs
without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

### Why Tailwind CSS? 🎨

Faster UI building process
It is a utility-first CSS framework which means we can use utility classes to build custom designs without writing CSS
as in the traditional approach.

### Advantages of Tailwind CSS: 🍃

<ul>
    <li>No more silly names for CSS classes and Id’s.</li>
    <li>Minimum lines of Code in CSS file.</li>
    <li>We can customize the designs to make the components.</li>
    <li>Makes the website responsive.</li>
    <li>Makes the changes in the desired manner.</li>
    <li>CSS is global in nature and if make changes in the file the property is changed in all the HTML files linked to it. But
    with the help of Tailwind CSS we can use utility classes and make local changes.</li>
</ul>
